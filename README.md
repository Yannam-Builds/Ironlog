## Current Android Feature Set

- Fast workout logging with set history, edit/delete, add exercise during session, rest timer, warm-up generation, and premium haptics.
- Plans, built-in program picker, goal modes, Program Insights, adaptive targets, and practical progression rules.
- Muscle analytics, volume radar, imbalance insights, recovery score, front/back recovery maps, and session quality summaries.
- Bodyweight tracking, progress photos, calendar history, stats, PR surfacing, weekly summaries, and share cards.
- AMOLED, light, and Monet-inspired theme variants with the same dense information layout across modes.
- Local-first SQLite storage, encrypted backup center, Drive backup targets, SQLite import/export, and notification policy controls.

## Themes

IronLog is not locked to one visual style. The current Android build ships with an AMOLED-first look, a full light theme, and Monet-inspired variants while keeping the same layout, contrast hierarchy, and training density across all of them.

## What Comes Next

- Phase 1: portability and migration with OpenWeight export/import, Strong and Hevy import review, duplicate detection, and alias resolution.
- Phase 2: coach-grade program building with mesocycle tools, progression models, `%1RM` prescriptions, and optional `RPE` / `RIR` support.
- Phase 3: explainability upgrades so progression, plateau, recovery, and imbalance outputs state why they fired and how confident they are.
- Phase 4: continuity and hardening for larger histories, export parity closure, deeper QA, and optional encrypted multi-device continuity where it genuinely helps.

## Data Ownership

- Internal source of truth: local SQLite on Android.
- Backup today: encrypted local snapshots, SQLite export/import, JSON/CSV flows, and optional Google Drive backup targets.
- Drive supports hidden `AppData` mode and visible folder mode. It is a backup target, not a fake always-on sync layer.
